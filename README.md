# 8-Puzzle Problem Solver

![8-Puzzle](puzzle.png)

This is a Python program that solves the classic 8-Puzzle problem using BFS algorithm.

## Introduction

The 8-Puzzle is a popular sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and an empty space. The goal is to arrange the tiles in the correct order by sliding them into the empty space. This project provides a Python implementation to solve the 8-Puzzle problem using BFS algorithm.

## Features

- Solves 8-Puzzle problems using BFS algorithm.
- Supports custom initial puzzle configurations.
- Displays solution path, moves, and search cost.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 8-Puzzle problem solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
